# Advanced EXIF Metadata Extractor

## Overview

This project is an advanced EXIF metadata extractor tool built with Streamlit. It provides a comprehensive suite of features for analyzing EXIF metadata in images, including extracting GPS coordinates, checking for hidden messages through steganography, analyzing timestamp inconsistencies, and exporting metadata to a JSON file.

## Features

- **EXIF Data Extraction:** Retrieve detailed EXIF metadata from uploaded images.
- **GPS Coordinates:** Extract and display GPS coordinates, with reverse geocoding to convert them into a human-readable address.
- **Timestamp Analysis:** Analyze image timestamps to detect potential modifications.
- **Camera and Lens Information:** Display detailed information about the camera and lens used to capture the image.
- **File Integrity:** Compute and display the SHA-256 hash of the uploaded file to verify its integrity.
- **Steganography Check:** Detect and reveal any hidden messages in the image using steganography techniques.
- **Metadata Export:** Export the extracted metadata to a downloadable JSON file.
